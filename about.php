<h3>Raleigh BPAC Planning Map - About</h3>

<p>This interactive map shows current, future, and long-term planned bicycle facilities in Raleigh, North Carolina. "Future" means within about the next year.</p>
<p>Facility types included are bike lanes, sharrows (shared lane markings), wide outside lanes, and miscellaneous.</p>
<p>The background is the Raleigh City Council districts on top of the Google Bicycle Layer, which shows greenways and other current bike facilities. The Google Bicycle layer contains mostly greenways, and some on-street facilities.</p>
