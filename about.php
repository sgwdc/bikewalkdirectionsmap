<h3>Raleigh BPAC Planning Map - About</h3>

<p>This interactive map shows current, future, and long-term planned bicycle facilities in Raleigh, North Carolina. This was designed to help the City of Raleigh's Bicycle &amp; Pedestrian Advisory Commission visualize current and proposed facilities to help prioritize funding.Facility types included are bike lanes, sharrows (shared lane markings), wide outside lanes, and miscellaneous.</p>
<p>Some map layers were converted from ArcGIS shapefiles, and others were hand drawn.</p>
<p>The background is the Raleigh City Council districts on top of the Google Bicycle Layer, which shows greenways and other current bike facilities. The Google Bicycle layer contains mostly greenways, and some on-street facilities.</p>
